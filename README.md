With the help of JAVA and DBMS, for the 12th class major project I created this masterpiece of a project.

<h1> Its a DB relational java project </h1>
With a simple login form and MD5 hashed password system.
I was in a only boys School and hostel(It was a bording school to be exact BVM,Nainital) so i only get only 2-3 hours per day to code and shit.
It ain't much but its honest work.
